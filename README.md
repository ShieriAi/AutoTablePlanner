This project aims to solve the ’Christmas Dinner Problem’, return a high-quality seating plan using up to 3 second for most of the events. An Android mobile phone application has been developed for this problem. This software can be used in following situation. A large group of people are planning to organise an annual Christmas Dinner. The event manager Dina is in charge of make all of the arrangements of the event. However, the guests in this event have their own distinct preference about seat selection. Dina needs to figure out a perfect balancing point to maximise the guests’ enjoyment of the dinner. The purposed of ’The Christmas Dinner Problem’ is to find out a seating arrangement for the events like Christmas Dinner which could satisfies as many guests as possible.The number of guests maybe 20, or 500 to somebody who in responsible for a seating arrangement. It is very painful to handle a good arrangement by hand by a single person. Therefore, the idea of this project is to build a program for people like Dina, to help her solving this kind of problem without calculation by hand. However, the number of possible seating arrangements grows up exponentially by the number of guests, which will costs a lot of time to loop throw every single seating plan and find out the optimal one.
